1. Description                                *SimpleSnipets-snippets-description*

SimpleSnipets-snippets provides various predefined snippet files for various
languages.

                                             *SimpleSnipets-snippets-requirements*
1.1 Requirements
----------------

This plugin can be used only with SimpleSnipets.vim. Snippet files are
incompatible with other snippet managers because of implementation. Therefore
snippets for some languages may not be presented here, and if someone can help
me with porting snippets from other snippet collections, your help is much
appreciated.

                                          *SimpleSnipets-snippets-acknowledgments*
1.3 Acknowledgments
-------------------

SimpleSnipets-snippets currently contains ports of snippets from
honza/vim-snippets. This is a huge collection of snippets made by large
community. Because of snippet syntax differences SimpleSnipets.vim can't use
these snippets, therefore they can be ported accordingly to SimpleSnipets.vim
documentation.

================================================================================
2. Installation and Updating               *SimpleSnipets-snippets-installnupdate*

Recommended way to install SimpleSnipets-snippets is to use plugin manager, such
as Vundle, Pathogen, dein.nvim or others. You can still install it manually by
cloning master branch from GitHub. Assuming you're using Vundle add this line
to your configuration file:

  `Plugin 'andreyorst/SimpleSnipets-snippets'`

3. Syntax                                          *SimpleSnipets-snippets-syntax*

This section fill describe how to create and add snippets for
SimpleSnipets-snippets plugin. For snippet syntax itself please refer to
SimpleSnipets.vim documentation.

                                          *SimpleSnipets-snippets-adding-filetype*
3.1 Creating snippet filetype
-----------------------------

Snippets are located at folder 'snippets' in your plugin installation directory.
Snippet files are stored per filetype, inside separate folders named
accordingly to those filetypes. You can add your filetype to this plugin, if
vim supports it, or has plugin for this filetype. Please name filetype
accordingly to how Vim displays it. You can check current filetype by
executing:

  `:echo &ft`

                                        *SimpleSnipets-snippets-creating-snippets*
3.2 Creating snippets

Snippets are stored inside filetype directory. Snippet file name is it's
trigger, so filename should be short and don't overlap. For more info on how
to write snippet files, please check SimpleSnipets.vim documentation.

                                             *SimpleSnipets-snippets-descriptions*
3.3 Description file

Snippets can contain description file, which is plain text file, that contains
all triggers, and short description about what this trigger does. For example:

`snippets/c/c.snippets.descriptions.txt`

`for: for(;;) {...}`
`main: main function definition`
`if: if(...) {...}`

As you may noticed, description filename is containing filetype. This is done
to make it harder to suddenly expand this file as a snippet.

This file is used by `SimpleSnipets#listSnippets()` function. But this file is
optional, because if this file is not exists, this function will use system `ls`
command output instead. However if you started to write this file please
include all triggers in it.

4. Contributing                              *SimpleSnipets-snippets-contributing*

SimpleSnipets-snippets aims to become at least as big as vim-snippets, or
bigger. This plugin is hard to develop alone because I don't know all
languages, and can't make meaningful snippets for them by myself. If you're
want to help, you can clone this plugin GitHub repo, add desired snippets, or
fix existing ones, and file a Pull Request. I'll test all snippets, and accept
it.

If you found a bug in snippet definition please consider opening an issue at:
